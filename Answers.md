1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side is when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. This makes for faster and smoother(after the initial request) loading because a new document is not being received again which refreshes the page.

Server-side requests causes the entire page to refresh because whole documents are being rendered. This may result in longer loading time and unnecessary data being requested such as headers and footers.
